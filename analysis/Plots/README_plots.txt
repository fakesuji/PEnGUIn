Plotting outputs appear here from:
- line.pbs, from the PEnGUIn/analysis directory which calculates lines and other analysis information, 
  calculate_lines.py, from the PEnGUIn/analysis directory.
- ecc_ang.pbs,  from the PEnGUIn/analysis directory which calculates eccentricty and angles and other 
  analysis information, calculate_ecc_ang.py, from the PEnGUIn/analysis directory.
- all notebooks and other python scripts implementing plotting methods from functions_plots.py.


The output directory is as follows:
- Plots/RUN_NAME/ANALYSIS_NAME
- this naming method groups by simulation run, then by analysis run on said simulation

- Plots/ecc_ang_analysis
- this folder holds analysis on eccentricity and angle analysis for simulation comparisons
